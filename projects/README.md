# `projects`

Projects in `/projects/` are independent, deployable applications. They stand completely separate from each other and must be able to be deployed independently (i.e. you can deploy _project1_ without deploying _project2_). If projects need code shared between them, that code belongs in [`/lib`](../lib/).
